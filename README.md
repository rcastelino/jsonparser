Write a working program code that will take the test_results.json file as an input and provide:
1) For each test suite:
	- Test suite name
	- Print out the total number of tests that passed and their details
	- Print out the total number of tests that failed and their details
	- Print out the total number of test that are blocked
	- Print out the total number of test that took more than 10 seconds to execute
2) Proper treatment for common error conditions
3) All the detail lists need to be printed in ascending order
4) Speed is first priority, memory is secondary
5) Java or Python
